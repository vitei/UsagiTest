UsagiTest
=========

A test application for the Usagi engine.  
Meant to show the correct usage rather than act as a demonstration of the features.  
Work is *not* being done on this project internally. It is only periodically updated to a (very basic) working state for version number increases because there is nothing more complex that can be made publically available at this time.
