UsagiTest
=========

A test application for the Usagi engine.  
Meant to show the correct usage rather than act as a demonstration of the features.  
Whilst submodules are far from perfect the engine is currently a submodule of this test.


Getting up and running
----------------------


1. Clone this repository recursively (under advanced options in sourcetree or specify --recursive at the command line)

1. Follow the instructions in the Usagin Engine README.md

1. Open UsagiTest.sln and right-click GenerateProjects and select build 
   This must currently be done per configuration

1. Open UsagiTest.sln and right-click Ayataka and select build
   It is recommended to do this in Release, Ayataka is the model converter and the fbx debug build is very slow
